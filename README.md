====
This project implements a development environment that helps users write SLogo programs.

Names: Libba Lou, Cayla Schuval, Aneesh Gupta, Turner Jordan

### Timeline
Start Date: February 20th, 2020

Finish Date: March 6th, 2020

Hours Spent: 180

### Primary Roles
Libba Lawrence: Implementing the controller module to interface between the front end and back end components. This includes implementing the Parser class to parse command strings taken from the front end.

Cayla Schuval: Responsible for implementing the entire front end package

Turner Jordan: Back-end package

Aneesh Gupta: Back-end package

### Resources Used
The CS308 Piazza board and lectures, Java and JavaFX documentation, and stack overflow for small fixes. 

### Running the Program
Main class: View

Data files needed: English.properties (and all other language property files), mover.png

Features implemented: Features described in the basic implementation (including commands in the command specification document)

### Notes/Assumptions
Assumptions or Simplifications:  

We assumed that the commands would each have a definite number of inputs.
We assumed a a definite style for the properties files.
We assumed that the pen follows the data points and the turtle also does, but they have separate coded paths. 

Interesting data files: NA

Known Bugs: 

* Lists within lists do not function properly with respect to parsing data
* Sometimes the turtle decides to stop drawing and you have to pendown to get it to work

Extra credit: NA

### Impressions
Coming for complete implementation
